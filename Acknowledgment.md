First and foremost I would like to thank God Almighty for showering us with all the his blessings for completion of this project successfully.

I also express my humble gratitude to my computer science teacher Mrs. Shiny Harris for her constant support and cooperation in clearing all doubts and for the inspiration received during the course of this project.

I sincerely acknowledge the goodwill and enthusiasm shown by our lab assistant <u>Mr. Jobin George</u> by providing all necessary helps without any delay.

I also thank our principal <u>Mrs. Sonia Susan Varkey</u> and Vice Principal <u>Mrs. Anju Priya B</u> for giving us the opportunity to work on <b>"ONLINE SHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"</b> which helped us to learn so many new and useful things while doing research on this project. Last but not least I want to express my thanks to my family and friends for their motivation and help.

Thank You.
