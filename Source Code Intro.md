# Source Code

## Prerequisites

The program is divided into smaller modules for better readability and easier management.
Here is the file structure:

```
admin.py
boxprint.py
cart.py
customer.py
db_create.py
error_corrector.py
main.py
sql_handler.py
```
`admin.py` and `customer.py` are the different interfaces. `cart.py` is a user defined module used by customer.py for certain functions.
